Similar to 'Run Commands' in NotePad++, 'User Tool' in EditPlus/UltraEdit, 'External Tool' in GEdit and 'Shell Commands' in TextMate. \n\nPreface\n-------\nThis package enables you to setup shell commands as atom commands. Shell output will be captured and display in the atom's bottom panel.If you create a command named 'gcc-build', you will find 'atom-shell-commands:gcc-build' in the atom command palette, and then use keymap to setup a shotcut for it.\n\nI was a window user and switched to Atom from EditPlus/Notepad++. Previously I wrote a script in EditPlus to compile-run my C/C++ programs and execute Makefiles with customizable compile flags and run options. Atom has numerous community packages and I have tried some. Most of them are really great in certain extent but still cannot fully satisfy my need. Therefore I decided to reference their packages and make my own.\n\nFeature\n-------\n\r\n- Customize shell command to invoke compiler or other tools with active document/project.\r\n- Customize arguments, working directory and system environment of the command.\r\n- Automatic create atom command for each shell command.\r\n- Keymap config allow you to make shortcut to each command.\r\n- Shell output (stdout/stderr) can be captured in the bottom panel.\r\n- Click the filename in the output panel will open it.\r\n- Regular expression to match filename and line number in the error output. \r\n- Hotkeys to navigate errors one by one just like quickfix in vim.\n- Fast and lightweight, loading time is less than 2 milliseconds (TimeCop). \n\nInstallation\n------------\n    apm install atom-shell-commands\n\nSetup\n-----\n\nConfigure commands on your config file (File->Open Your Config, or ~/.atom/config.cson) like this, add 'atom-shell-commands' in your user config file:\n```cson\n  \"atom-shell-commands\":\n    commands: [\n      {\n        name: \"compile\"\n        command: \"d:/dev/mingw/bin/gcc\"\n        arguments: [\n          \"{FileName}\"\n          \"-o\"\n          \"{FileNameNoExt}.exe\"\n        ]\n        options:\n          cwd: \"{FileDir}\"\n          keymap: 'ctrl-2'\n      }\n    ]\n```\nThis will create the atom command \"atom-shell-commands:compile\" that you can now launch from the command palette or use the binding keymap 'ctrl-2'. It also generates an entry in the Atom Shell Commands menu under packages. A certain command is represented by:\n\n| Field | Mode | Description |\n|-------|----|---------|\n| `name` | **[required]** | The name of the target. Viewed in the menu | \n| `command` | **[required]** | The executable command |\n| `auguments` | *[optional]* | An array of arguments for the command |\n| `selector` | *[optional]* | atom selector, default is 'atom-workspace' |\n| `matchs` | *[optional]* | regular expression to match file name in output |\n| `options` | *[optional]* | additional options to config dir, environment, keymap etc |\n\nThe `command`, `arguments` and `options` values accepts the variables below:\n\n| Macros           | Description |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| {FilePath}       | File name of current document with full path. |\n| {FileName}       | File name of current document without path. |\n| {FileDir}        | Full path of current document without the file name |\n| {FileExt}        | File extension of current document |\n| {FileNameNoExt}  | File name of current document without path and extension |\n| {ProjectDir}     | Current project directory |\n| {ProjectRel}     | File name relativize to current project directory |\n| {CurRow}         | Current row(line number) where the cursor is located |\n| {CurCol}         | Current column index where the cursor is located |\n| {CurSelected}    | Selected text |\n| {CurLineText}    | Current line text under cursor |\n| {CurWord}        | Current word under cursor |\n\nYou can setup as many commands as you wish to build with your project makefile, or compile a single source file directly, or compile your latex, or run grep in current directory, passing current word under cursor to external man help / dictionary / other external scripts, or just call svn diff with current file and redirect the output to the bottom panel.\n\n\nThe `options` field is an key/value object contains:\n\n| Options | Mode | Description |\n|---------|------|-------|\n| cwd | *[optional]* | Working directory of the command |\n| save | *[optional]* | True or false(default) to save the current file before execute |\n| silent | *[optional]* | True or false(default); true will not show the message panel (if it's closed) when this command is run. |\n| keymap | *[optional]* | A keymap string as defined by Atom. Pressing this key combination will trigger the target. Examples: ctrl-alt-k or cmd-U. |\n| env | *[optional]* | Key/value based system environment setting |\n| sound | *[optional]* | File path for a wav/mp3/ogg file which will be played to remind you that the job is finished |\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nCompiling with command 'gcc'\n\n![](https://github.com/skywind3000/atom-shell-commands/blob/master/images/command_compile.png?raw=true)\n\nRunning with command 'execute'\n\n![](https://github.com/skywind3000/atom-shell-commands/blob/master/images/command_execute.png?raw=true)\n\ncommand 'execute' config:\n```cson\n      {\n        name: \"execute\"\n        command: \"{FileNameNoExt}\"\n        options:\n          cwd: \"{FileDir}\"\n      }\n```\n\nRunning in a new window\n\n![](https://github.com/skywind3000/atom-shell-commands/blob/master/images/command_runinwindow.png?raw=true)\n\ncommand 'runinwindow' config:\n```cson\n      {\n        name: \"runinwindow\"\n        command: \"cmd\"\n        arguments: [\n          \"/C\"\n          \"start\"\n          \"d:/software/atom/launch.cmd\"\n          \"{FileNameNoExt}\"\n        ]\n        options:\n          cwd: \"{FileDir}\"\n      }\n```\n\nyou need to write a batch file in windows to open a new window, here is source of launch.cmd:\n```\n@echo off\n%1\npause\nexit\n```\n\nLookup word in manual\n\nCurrent word under cursor can be passed to the external executables or scripts, you can use it to look up current word in dictionary or manual with a single hotkey stroke:\n\n```cson\n{\n  name: \"man\"\n  command: \"/usr/bin/man\"\n  arguments: [\n      \"{CurWord}\"\n  ]\n  options:\n    cwd: \"{FileDir}\"\n    keymap: \"ctrl-alt-m\"\n}\n```\n\nError Matching\n--------------\n\nError matching lets you specify a single regular expression or a list of regular expressions, which capture the output of your build command and open the correct file, row and column of the error. For instance:\n\n```\nztest_hello.cpp: In function 'int main()':\nztest_hello.cpp:7:10: error: expected initializer before 'int'\n```\n\nWould be matched with the expression: `^(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._\\\\\\\\:]+):(?<line>\\\\d+):(?<col>\\\\d+):`. After the build has failed, click on the error output line, the file would be opened and the cursor would be placed at row 7, column 10.\n\nNote the syntax for match groups. This is from the [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) package\nand has the syntax for named groups: `(?<name> RE )` where `name` would be the name of the group\nmatched by the regular expression `RE`.\n\nThe following named groups can be matched from the output:\n  * `file` - **[required]** the file to open. May be relative `cwd` or absolute. `(?<file> RE)`.\n  * `line` - *[optional]* the line the error resides on. `(?<line> RE)`.\n  * `col` - *[optional]* the column the error resides on. `(?<col> RE)`.\n\nSince the regular expressions are written in the user config file as .cson format, backslashes must be escaped.\n\nThe `file` should be an absolute path, or relative the `cwd` specified. If no `cwd` has been specified, default value '/' will be used.\n\nExample user config file which is using error matching:\n\n```cson\n*:\n  \"atom-shell-commands\":\n    commands: [\n      {\n        name: \"compile\"\n        command: \"d:/dev/mingw/bin/gcc\"\n        arguments: [\n          \"{FileName}\"\n          \"-o\"\n          \"{FileNameNoExt}.exe\"\n        ]\n        matchs: [\n          \"^(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._\\\\\\\\:]+):(?<line>\\\\d+):(?<col>\\\\d+):\"\n          \"^(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._\\\\\\\\:]+):(?<line>\\\\d+):\"\n          \"^(?<file>[\\\\/0-9a-zA-Z\\\\._\\\\\\\\:]+)\\\\s*\\\\((?<line>\\\\d+)\\\\)\\\\s*:*:\"\n        ]\n        options:\n          cwd: \"{FileDir}\"\n          keymap: 'ctrl-2'\n          save: true\n      }\n    ]\n```\n\nThis will match the `file`, `line` and `col` in both clang/gcc or msvc error output.\n\nQuickfix\n--------\n\nAtom-shell-commands has a special design in the output panel to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  This is inspired by the quickfix mode in vim. The idea is to save the error messages from the compiler and use builtin commands to jump to the errors one by one.  You can examine each problem and fix it, without having to remember all the error messages.\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------|\n| atom-shell-commands-config:error-first | go to the first error |\n| atom-shell-commands-config:error-last | go to the last error |\n| atom-shell-commands-config:error-next | go to the next error |\n| atom-shell-commands-config:error-prev | go to the previous error |\n\nTo avoid hotkey conflict to other packages, Atom-shell-commands has none predefined keymap, just leave the it to user. You can trigger them from `Atom Shell Commands` menu under `Packages`, or from command palette directly. \n\nThe most efficient way is binding to your keymap config by simply adding few lines in ~/.atom/keymap.cson （or open it in the `File` menu):\n```cson\n'atom-workspace':\n    'F9' : 'atom-shell-commands-config:error-next'\n    'F10': 'atom-shell-commands-config:error-prev'\n```\n\nNow you can have your F9/F10 to navigate errors without leaving your hand from keyboard to mouse/touch pad. \n\nMisc\n----\natom-shell-commands has been tested in windows, mac os and ubuntu. You can use 'open' in mac os or '/usr/bin/gnome-terminal' in ubuntu to open a new window and execute your command. \n\nAs executing program in a new terminal window correctly is a little tricky thing, I create a script to let you open a new terminal window to execute your program in both Windows, Linux (ubuntu), Cygwin and Mac OS X, you can try it from: https://github.com/skywind3000/terminal.\n\nTO-DO\n-----\n- Commands could be setup in a new GUI window, not only in user config.\n\n\n\nReference\n---------\n\n- [https://github.com/DPISA/atom-user-commands](https://github.com/DPISA/atom-user-commands \"atom-user-commands\") (based on it).\r\n- [https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus) (referenced).\r\n- [https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) (referenced).\n- [https://github.com/ksxatompackages/cmd-exec](https://github.com/ksxatompackages/cmd-exec) (referenced).\n\n\n\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"atom-shell-commands@1.4.0","_shasum":"c79f7521775b08b22345ea60d6a6cebd22184b83","_resolved":"file:../d-116518-5705-16wqajt/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116518-5705-16wqajt/package.tgz"}
