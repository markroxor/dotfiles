The only current officially\nsupported distributions are [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), and\n[MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/). Although the latter is not as well tested and\nsupported as TeX Live, hence using TeX Live is highly recommended.\n\nYou need to ensure that the package can find your TeX distribution; to help the\npackage find the distribution's binaries, you need to configure the *TeX Path*\nconfiguration variable to point to the folder containing the binaries. This can\nbe done either in the settings view, or directly in your `config.cson` file.\n\n#### TeX Live\nIf you're using TeX Live and have installed to the default location then no\nfurther action should be required.\n\n#### MiKTeX\nIf you're using MikTeX and have installed to the default location then all you\nshould need to do is change the *Builder* to `texify`. This can be done either\nin the settings view, or directly in your `config.cson` file.\n\n## Usage\nInvoke the `build` command by pressing the default keybind `ctrl-alt-b` while in\na `.tex` file.\n\n### Magic comments\nThe package has support for the following Tex Magic comments\n- `% !TEX root = ../file.tex` Select root file\n- `% !TEX program = pdflatex` Select Latex Engine (pdflatex,lualatex,xelatex)\n\n## Status\nPlease note that this package is in a **beta** state. As an example, there's no\nproper error and warning handling. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n\n## TODO\nCurrent wish list, in a semi-prioritized order.\n\n- [ ] Build output.\n  - [x] Error handling.\n  - [ ] Warnings, and other non-critical messages.\n- [ ] Project management.\n  - [ ] Setting to override the output directory.\n  - [ ] Setting to override the builder.\n\nIf you see something that's missing, or disagree with the prioritization,\nconsider submitting a [feature request](https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues?labels=feature&state=open),\nand if you're feeling super helpful, submit a pull request with an updated\nTODO list :sparkling_heart:\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/thomasjo/atom-latex#readme","_id":"latex@0.33.0","_shasum":"8653e863824457cf12e54b484f8acc3890ab9836","_resolved":"file:../d-116517-5698-13wksyj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116517-5698-13wksyj/package.tgz"}
